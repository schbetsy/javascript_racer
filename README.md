Javascript Racer
================
This was a project from week 5 of Dev Bootcamp. It is a simple game: each player presses a key repeatedly to move their icon down the track. The first player to the end of the track wins. The game can take any number of players between 2 and 6. The results of each race are stored in the database, so a player can view their previous rounds.

This was my first experience building extensive front-end functionality with Javascript. I added a special challenge to the original assignment by deciding to make the game work for any number of players. On the front page of the app, where the user enters all of the names of the players in this round, I use javascript to dynamically add as many player fields as the user wants. Gameplay is also scalable to any number of players, since the view is dynamically created when the user enters their information.

It's not a well-polished user experience, but it gave me the chance to solidify my knowledge about loops and arrays in js, data tags in HTML and embedded Ruby, as well as dynamicallty-created pages and using jQuery to manipulate the DOM.
